## Guidelines for Research Centers and Associated Organizations

We ask all YSPH research centers to adopt a Yale wordmark instead of an independent logo on their web pages. Research Centers such as CIRA, EIP, Cancer Prevention and Control, and YCAS may continue to use their logos on their printed and online publications in conjunction with the YSPH Wordmark.

## Colors

Yale Blue is the university’s identifying color, and has the hex value #00356b. The standard range of blue tints is shown in the primary color palette below along with the standard range of grays and three accent colors. Additional colors may be used as long as they complement, rather than clash with, the colors in the primary color palette.

BLUES:    #00356B, #286dc0, and #63aaff

GRAYS:    #222222, #4a4a4a, #978d85, #dddddd

ACCENTS:  #ffd55a, #5f712d, #bd5319


## Typeface

YaleNew (serif font that looks like Times New Roman) for headings 1-4, with variations in size and color.
Mallory (a sans-serif font) for heading 5 and body text.

A screenshot showing the YSPH use of these fonts is provided for context: “Website Typeface Example.png”


## White Space & Layout

The Yale web design standards make use of generous sizes for type, photos, and other design elements with plenty of white space between them. Every section and component of the design avoids being small and cramped. The layout grid offers large gutter spaces between columns and there is extra line-space between major divisions on a page.

Web page layouts should always be handled via a responsive grid system. Older fixed-width grids and layout methods should no longer be used since they do not display well across various screen sizes and devices.
